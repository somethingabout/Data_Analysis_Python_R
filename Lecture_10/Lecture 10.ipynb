    "## Mutate\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to add a new columns that are functions of existing columns - and that function is `mutate()`\n",
    "\n",
    "mutate() always adds new columns at the end of your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a whole variety of new variables, as in python. Here are some useful tips on this: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Arithmetic operators**: +, -, *, /, ^. These are all vectorised, using the so called “recycling rules”. If one parameter is shorter than the other, it will be automatically extended to be the same length. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Modular arithmetic**: %/% (integer division) and %% (remainder), where x == y * (x %/% y) + (x %% y). Modular arithmetic is a handy tool because it allows you to break integers up into pieces. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Logs**: log(), log2(), log10(). Logarithms are an incredibly useful transformation for dealing with data that ranges across multiple orders of magnitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Offsets**: lead() and lag() allow you to refer to leading or lagging values. This allows you to compute running differences (e.g. x - lag(x)) or find when values change (x != lag(x)). This is useful for regressions with time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logical comparisons**, <, <=, >, >=, !=, and == If you’re doing a complex sequence of logical operations it’s often a good idea to store the interim values in new variables so you can check that each step is working as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ranking**: there are a number of ranking functions, but you should start with min_rank(). It does the most usual type of ranking (e.g. 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 4th). The default gives smallest values the small ranks; use desc(x) to give the largest values the smallest ranks.\n"
