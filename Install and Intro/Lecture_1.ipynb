    "- Learn basics of coding in Python and R\n",
    "- Practical application of statistics and econometrics using Python and R\n",
    "    - This course complements stats and metrics and is not a substitute. If you haven't taken these courses in the past, you may get lost. \n",

    "- How to visualize data (and tell a story with graphs).\n",
