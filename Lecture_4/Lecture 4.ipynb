They link up websites, desktops, smartphones, etc - and when they are the link to something else, then the two are \"integrated.\" APIs are everywhere, but when you rarely see them as the user. An API will talk with a **client**, which is program that exchanges data with a server through an API. \n",

    "APIs are technically a way for two different applications to communicate. They are set of rules (interface) that the two sides agree to follow. The company publishing the API implements their side of the rules by writing a program and putting it on a server. \n",

    "\n",
    "REST uses standard HTTP commands which means that getting data from an API is similar to accessing a webpage. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, When you type `www.duckduckgo.com` in your browser, your browser is asking the `www.duckduckgo.com` server for a webpage by making a `GET` HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request. Making a `GET` request to a RESTful API instead retrieves data (rather than a webpage).\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, while your browser uses `POST` to submit the contents of a form, REST APIs use `POST` to update data.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST APIs also uses other HTTP commmands such as `PUT` - for creating data - and `DELETE` - for removing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP is a text-based protocol (the response is always text) and could return a response in any format - this is typically found in the API documentation - though data is more often than not returned in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "As they are used to retrieve data `GET` requests are the most commonly used type of request, and again, is why we restrict ourselves to `GET` in this class"

    "## Responses\n",

    "These are coded - they let you know the result of your request with a **status code**\n",

    "* `200` - Success\n",
    "* `300` - The API is redirecting to a different endpoint\n",
    "* `400` - Bad request\n",
    "* `401` - Not authenticated\n",

    "<img src=\"text_csv.png\"width = 500 >\n",
    "</td></tr></table>\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "It just means that the data is stored comma separated.  When excel opens up the file, it typically recognizes the format and will automatically display the information so that each cell is inputted separately when it sees a comma\n",
    "\n",
    "## TSV\n",
    "\n",
    "TSV is very similar, instead of it being comma seperated, it is tab separated (and is often read as `\\t` when you import it.\n",

Sometimes this is just to make sure that you aren't abusing the system - they may want to know how often you use the data or they may limit your access to certain information or  they may only allow certain people to access their server, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For government data, all you need is to request an API key  - a long string of letters and numbers - this key is personalized. Anything you do they will know it is related to you. So, if you give it to other people, they might deactivate your key. Generally, don't share your key or you might be violating their terms.\n",

    "Authentication is website or owner specific. Everyone has their own way of asking for it and you're going to figure out how to access it correctly (read the specific API docs)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some common approaches:\n",
    "- put the key in the Authorization header, in lieu of a username and password. \n",
    "- add the key onto the URL (http://example.com?api_key=my_secret_key) (I have mostly seen this in government data)\n",
    "- Less common is to bury the key somewhere in the request body next to the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Wherever the key goes, the effect is the same - it lets the server authenticate the client.\n",
